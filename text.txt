The story of Jay and Vijay

Two friends living in a small village near the city of Jaipur called Jay and Vijay. They were friends from childhood and studied in a college with each other. The college was far from their place of residence. They had to cross the river and the hills and pass over sandy areas so they could go to college together.

On one rainy day, Jay and Vijay had to walk to the college as usual, and on their way they were discussing what they had learned about atomic theory in college. And they differed in their views, which led to sharp discussions between them until they reached the use of obscene language. In a fit of anger, Jay Vijay slapped Vijay out of his friend and got angry and wrote on the sand: "Today my best friend slapped me." Then both of them completed walking toward the college with a clear silence.

On their way to the river that was overflowing, Vijay walked toward the river, knowing that he could not swim. He began to sink, and with the force of the flow of water and the flood he felt as if the river would take him irreversibly.

Jay saw his friend drown and without thinking jumped into the river to save him, and was able to pull him and helped him to recover his breath naturally. When Vijay recovered, he wrote on his way to the hill: "Today my best friend saved my life."

Jay wondered and asked his friend: Why did you write on the sand when I slapped you? And why did you write on the hill when you saved your life? Vijay replied: "My friend has to forget the mistake one of us makes to the other. I write on the sand because the words will be erased at any one time, but if a friend does something good to him, he should remember it and write it on the stones to stay forever. Then Jay Vijay embraced and completed their way to college as if nothing had happened.
